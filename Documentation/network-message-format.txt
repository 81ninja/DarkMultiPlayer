All messages include an int (4 byte) header for type, and an int (4 byte) for length.

All messages use the MessageWriter serialiser.

Shared format:
HEARTBEAT: null - Just sends some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.
CHAT_MESSAGE: string - name, string - message.

Client only:
HANDSHAKE_REQUEST: int - Protocol version, string - Player name, string - Guid (player token).
HANDSHAKE_RESPONSE: bool - Successful connection

Server only:
HANDSHAKE_RESPONSE: int - Connection status
0 - Success
1 - Protocol mismatch
2 - Player already connected
3 - Token mismatch
99 - Malformed message

TODO: Actually write documentation on how my message writer works. The code is here anyway, this is how I built the MessageWriter.dll file: https://github.com/godarklight/BinarySerialiser
